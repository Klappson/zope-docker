# The PF-Zope-Docker

This docker will create a zope-setup consisting of

* Zope
    * **Batteries included!!**
    * Products.PythonScripts
    * Products.ZSQLMethods
    * Products.SiteErrorLog
    * Products.StandardCacheManagers
    * Products.ExternalMethod
    * Products.MailHost
* PostgreSQL
* ZODBsync

# Setup
## Easy
```bash
./BuildImage
./StartDocker
```
**THAT'S IT!**
The Zope-Server will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`

# Advanced
You may want to keep your changes even after the container has been deleted. The following volumes are available

## /vol/zoperepo
This Folder will contain the dumps of ZODBsync

## /vol/postgres_data
This Folder will contain the data generated by postgres

Create a container using the volumes by using
```bash
docker run \
    -it \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    --mount type=bind,source=<path on your maschine>,target=/vol/zoperepo \
    --mount type=bind,source=<path on your maschine>,target=/vol/postgres_data \
    --name pf-zope-docker \
    klappson/pf-zope-setup
```

# Planned
* Fully include HaProxy
    * And The Possibility to enable HTTPS
* Allow more configuration files to be edited
* Add Possibility to add custom Products
* Add Possibility to add a github-link as zoperepo
    * Fetch and playback everytime the container starts
* Cleanup. This whole thing is a pretty huge case of "let's just try this"
